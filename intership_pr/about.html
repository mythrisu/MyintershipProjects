        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>A clay cart is a specialized vehicle historically used to transport clay from its source, such as clay pits or mines, to various destinations for processing and utilization. These carts are designed with robust wooden frames and sturdy wheels to bear the weight of the clay, often featuring slanted beds for easier loading and unloading. In the past, clay carts played a crucial role in industries like pottery, brick-making, and construction, facilitating the movement of raw clay to workshops and kilns. While less common in modern industrial contexts, clay carts continue to hold historical and cultural significance, and their legacy persists in some traditional and artisanal practices.
